## Hey there!
![hey there cpp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116419708/225995365-c9e80994-9d72-4fdc-b92c-b5a6f18841ad.gif)

### My name is Tyrael and I **love** coding and teaching whatever I can! I hope you find at least some of these materials helpful.

I like learning and one of my biggest gripes with the education system is how they give it such a bad rep. So this is a passion project of mine,
that will hopefully help someone out there enjoy learning about coding as much as I do. :hugs:

Do note that most of these do not come from an actual Education background, but from someone who just wants to share some cool stuff he learned about.
<sub> Plus I quite enjoy writing Markdown here :\></sub>
