## Hey there!
![hey there cpp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116419708/225995365-c9e80994-9d72-4fdc-b92c-b5a6f18841ad.gif)

### My name is Tyrael and I **love** coding and teaching whatever I can!

I like learning and one of my biggest gripes with the education system is how they give it such a bad rep. So this is a passion project of mine,
that will hopefully help someone out there enjoy learning about coding as much as I do. :hugs:

Do note that most of these do not come from an actual Education background, but from someone who just wants to share some cool stuff he learned about.
<sub> Plus I quite enjoy writing Markdown here :\></sub>

## **TABLE OF CONTENTS :**
### *Most of the code here will be in C++ or Python*

- [ ] [Code Readability, or Coding for Human Consumption](READABILITY/README.md)
  - Make aesthetically pleasing chaos machines.
- [ ] [Pointers, and Pointers that point to Pointers, and Pointers that...](POINTERS/README.md)
  - All about pointers and why they're actually pretty cool.
- [ ] [Mathematics?!](MATH/README.md)
  - Logarithms, Binary Operations and Python Combinatorics?!!?!?!
- [ ] [Iterators, Unpacking, and Python](LOOP/README.md)
  - Stuff that repeat, or stuff that can be repeated, and the stuff that come from them. (ft. Python)
- [ ] [String Theory. But with no Quantum Physics](STRING/README.md)
  - All about **S**trings and manipulating them.
- [ ] [Object-Oriented Programming (but not like, all of it)](OOP/README.md)
  - Classes/Objects and the mindset behind orienting everything around them.
- [ ] [C++ Arrays, Vectors, other Abstract Data Types, and where to find them](ADT/README.md)
  - The unofficial definitive guide to Abstract Data Types, or handling your data more efficiently.
- [ ] [JSONS and leaving a lasting impression](JSON/README.md)
  - JSONS are awesome, especially if you want to make digital footprints locally (like in your PC).
- [ ] [Manic-Pixie Dream Functions (more commonly known as Lambdas)](LAMBDA/README.md)
  - Making anonymous functions that are just overall super convenient.
- [ ] [Creating Cool Stuff with the Cool Things you learned!](COOLSTUFF/README.md)
  - If you're like me, you like learning stuff you know you can apply. So go henceforth, create and destroy.


*... and possibly more*

I hope you find at least some of these materials helpful.
